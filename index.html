		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Welcome to my portfolio page! I am a keen data 
analyst and researcher, and as a budding web developer I decided to 
make my portfolio from scratch. Please bear this in mind - this page 
is in early development</p>

		<h3>EPC Analysis of Warm Welcome Spaces</h3>
		<p>Warm Welcome is a scheme run by the Good Faith 
Partnership. It partners with a variety of public spaces to provide a 
'warm' and 'welcome' environment, promoting community belonging and 
connection. With ongoing and future proposals regarding energy 
requirements/net zero targets, energy efficiency, and the measure of it, 
has been a major theme in the charity sector within my experience. I 
analysed the EPC data for the Warm Welcome spaces and created a 
streamlit app to enable partners and stakeholders to interact 
with and visualise the findings.</p>

		<h3>Cost Calculator</h3>
		<p>Part of the assessment of grantees involved calculating 
the value for money of each project, involving various metrics about the 
project. Often I would recieve ad-hoc requests for the figure from 
internal and external stakeholders. At the time I was working on my web 
development skills and created a cost calculator on CodePen. I gave the 
link to external grant managers to save time and allow them to use it at 
their convenience.</p>

		<h3>Scavenger Hunt App</h3>
		<p>Someone I knew had made an instagram story about how 
much time and difficulty they had experienced in planning their annual 
birthday 'scavenger hunt'. At the time, I was creating Streamlit apps both 
to develop my personal skills and to test for use within the grants and 
loans teams. I got in touch with this person and ended up making them a 
Streamlit app for their hunt. It was a huge success as a last minute 
solution (it was 2 days from the scheduled hunt) and I recieved many 
compliments for attendees!</p>
